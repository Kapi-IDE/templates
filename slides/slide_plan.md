## The Engineer's Challenge

**Critical data needed to drive operations and innovation is trapped in unstructured documents**

- Engineering organizations struggle with massive knowledge fragmentation across PLM systems
- Millions of documents in various formats contain critical IP
- Engineers waste significant time searching through disparate systems
- Teams often rebuild solutions that already exist due to poor discovery
- Tribal knowledge gap directly impacts product development timelines and costs

## Customer Pain Points

![Engineers searching for information](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400)

- **Fragmented Knowledge**: Expensive and inefficient manual search across systems
- **Wasted Resources**: High risk of recreating existing solutions due to poor discovery
- **Knowledge Loss**: Erosion of tribal knowledge and institutional memory
- **Time Drain**: Significant time waste in document comprehension and synthesis
- **Compliance Challenges**: Difficulty tracking and reporting on ESG requirements
